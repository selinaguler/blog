I am really seeking something to change my whole settled brain chemistry. I am not happy with the way I think, the way I process and make conclusions, not happy about my decision making capabilities. I am talking about very slight aspects of decision making. I am not gonna talk about how I regret my decisions in life, the college or field I choosed or boys I ghosted or did nothing about who ghosted me but more about how treat mechanism in my brain is not clicking.
