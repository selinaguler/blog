I am really seeking something to change my whole settled brain chemistry. I am not happy with the way my brain works, how it make conclusions, and not happy about my decision making capabilities. I am talking about very slight aspects of decision making. I am not gonna talk about regrets of my decisions in life, the field I choosed or people who I didn't give enough credits but more about how treat mechanism in my brain is not clicking. And this is certainly my fault. I am seeking ways to fix this.

I am not diagnosed, however, I am struggling with depression and social anxiety on daily basis. Same thought flows daily and damaging level of overthinking that makes my brain fuzzy. I moved abroad recently for my studies, but still, nothing changed. 

I was actually considering moving abroad would actually help me with my brain's current state of being. But unfortunately, I am equivalently miserable and unhappy. Actually these adjectives are not the most accurate, more of think it as a lack of peace in me. But I don't phrase it this way a lot, since it makes it way more dramatic. But that is pretty much how it feels.

The state of mind of mine is for surely comes from my parents. I am not a psychology expert, but knowing my parents enough to call this and as growing up, I can tell my brain is very much like theirs. This part worths a mention, but it doesn't help pratically at all.

On the other hand, I grow up a place very rural. Small friend groups and not very much diversity. This worths a mention too but again, not helping pratically.

As of today I am lacking social skills and a healthy way of thinking regarding new experiences. Here I am airing the problem! I need to overcome this pit, otherwise I am not gonna make it.

Lack of peace is the main concern, since I know I can be actually happy. But not too easily. It requires a scramble to get a good way of satisfaction. And as long as I know myself I have been working on it.

Yeah, so far I have been working on it without any treats and any positive feedbacks. I was enjoying the process but it feels like it is falling apart. Also, I have been questioning more as I grow and learn more, and sticking to a plan that I made in a not very healthy state of mind is causing issues right now. That I thought I knew what I want, and insist on that, but turned out to be I actually not really want what I thought I want. Not that I want something else, and the plan still seems solid and sensible, but that I am now considering this idea of not knowing is okay and very much with me. I stopped deceiving myself. It sounds positive, but is it?
